# KapiLib (WIP)

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/TengLun/kapiLib)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/TengLun/kapiLib)

This project contains clients for all of Kochava's public APIs. The four
APIs are explained in brief below:


## CampaignClient
The Campaign Management API Integration provides the programmatic tools to create 
and maintain campaigns, segments and trackers.

## FraudClient
Fraud Console information access and programmatic additions and removals from
the account blacklist.

## S2SClient (Incomplete)
A Sever to Server (S2S) Integration is a method of integrating an app with Kochava 
without a SDK or any code change required in the app.

### ReportsClient (Incomplete)
The Kochava platform provides extensive tools to track everything from impressions 
thru post-install events for connected devices. The API reporting method provides 
advertisers with the programmatic tools to gather performance data on an on-demand 
or scheduled basis.
